# instead of merging (e.g. a fan-speed change followed shortly by a
# temperature change loses the fan change).

# setAirconStat write on top of the regular read-only poll, but it stays on

# round trip (see todo.md), so there's no reason to throttle it below the
# regular poll cadence. See Device._maybe_request_service_data().
SERVICE_DATA_REQUEST_INTERVAL = MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_UPDATES

# The rate limit is a guard against a second request inside the same cycle, not
# a cadence of its own: the request is scheduled once per poll anyway. It has to
# stay clear of the poll interval it is measured against, because the stamp is
# taken when a poll finishes, not when it was due. Polls arrive exactly
# MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_UPDATES apart, so a poll answering a few milliseconds faster
# than the one before it leaves marginally less than that between the two
# stamps - and with the full interval as the limit, that dropped the cycle. On
# the unit in #230 it cost 6 of 36 cycles of operation data, every one of them
# short by under 100ms.
SERVICE_DATA_MIN_SPACING = SERVICE_DATA_REQUEST_INTERVAL * 0.75

# ...but it does matter *where* in the cycle it lands. Issued straight off the
# back of a poll it reached the module about a second after the getAirconStat
# (consolidation delay plus the minimum spacing between requests), and modules
# answer a second request that soon with HTTP 501 "Not supported this command"
# often enough to lose whole cycles of operation data - roughly one poll in
# seven on the unit reported in #230, sometimes several minutes in a row.
# Offsetting it into the quiet middle of the cycle keeps the cadence but stops
# it from crowding the poll.

# the polls in between (see Device._carry_forward_service_data()) - but not

# temperature on screen for as long as the unit stays out of range. Which is a

# It used to equal the per-request timeout, and that combination has a trap
# (#236): a unit that accepts a plaintext connection without answering it
# consumes the whole window on the first leg, so the second protocol is never
# reached. If that unit only speaks the second protocol, every poll fails the

# Three polls at MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_UPDATES is roughly three minutes of grace,
# which rides through the reassociation without hiding a device that is

# only ever produced the phantom outages this floor exists to prevent.
